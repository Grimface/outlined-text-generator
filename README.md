# outlined-text-generator
Java command-line app for generating PNG images of supplied text, coloured white and outlined in black.

It won't do line breaks, so if you need text broken over several lines, you'll need to generate a new image per line.

1st version of this will have a single default font and a fixed image size. In future I'll try and make both of these more easily changeable.
