# outlined-text-generator
Java command-line app for generating PNG images of supplied text, coloured white and outlined in black.

It won't do line breaks, so if you need text broken over several lines, you'll need to generate a new image per line.

By default, the image will be 200px high by 800px wide, but you can override this if needed.
